# Description

Survival Tools is an mod that adds a number of tools and machines used to regulate player temperature and thirst. This mod has built-in support for both Tough As Nails and SimpleDifficulty and includes tools useful for both lightly and heavily modded environments.

One of the most unique features of Survival Tools is the implementation of the fluid containers such as canteens. Whereas SimpleDifficulty and Tough as Nails use  abstract item tags or weird item damage to determine the type of fluid and the number of draughts, Survival Tools items are fully functional fluid containers.

This means Survival Tools items can be filled and emptied by interacting with fluid tanks, world fluids and even modded bottling/filling machines. However, this comes with a limitation, Survival Tools fluid containers can ***only*** hold Purified Water.

# Modules
## Simple Tools
### Canteen
Canteens come in two varieties, the basic Canteen and the Reinforced Canteen. Players can drink from canteens directly to restore thirst.
<br><br>

### Hydration Packs
An upgraded version of the canteen, the hydration pack features a much larger fluid capacity and a higher fluid to thirst restored efficiency. However, players cannot drink from Hydration Packs directly. Instead, they will automatically hydrate the player when worn.

Hydration Packs can be equipped to the Body bauble slot or attached to any chestplate. When the pack or the armor it is attached to is worn, the pack will automatically hydrate the player and drain a small amount of fluid once a certain thirst threshold is reached.

### Handheld Purifier
All of these wonderful canteens and hydration packs would be useless without some way to fill them. Constantly spamming charcoal filters or boiling buckets of water in furnaces is more of an annoyance than an "interesting game mechanic".

The Handheld Purifier allows players to convert normal water into purified water. Simply hold an empty bottle, empty bucket, or any other fluid container in your offhand and use the Handheld Purifier while targeting a water source block or a fluid tank containing water.

After a short duration, up to 1 bucket of liquid will be drained from the water source and converted into purified water stored in the offhand item.

The Portable Regulator is a RF powered item that, when enabled, regulates the body temperature of the player. This item can be worn as a bauble and will function worn or sitting in a player's inventory.

The Portable Purifier can only be filled with normal water but will automatically purify the contained water. It can be worn as a bauble and will function worn or sitting in a player's inventory.
