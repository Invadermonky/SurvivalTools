# Survival Tools
Survival Tools is an mod that adds a number of tools and machines used to regulate player temperature and thirst. This mod has built-in support for both Tough As Nails and SimpleDifficulty and includes tools useful for both lightly and heavily modded environments.

One of the most unique features of Survival Tools is the implementation of the fluid containers such as canteens. Whereas SimpleDifficulty and Tough as Nails use  abstract item tags or weird item damage to determine the type of fluid and the number of draughts, Survival Tools items are fully functional fluid containers.

This means Survival Tools items can be filled and emptied by interacting with fluid tanks, world fluids and even modded bottling/filling machines. However, this comes with a limitation, Survival Tools fluid containers can ***only*** hold Purified Water.
